# Claude ↔ Codex Handoff

Shared handoff file for the Learning repository. It mirrors the three sections of
the "Claude-codex" Google Doc so both agents can work from the repository alone.

- Codex (ChatGPT) maintains sections 1 and 3 and owns all execution, testing and
  final verification.
- Claude maintains section 2 and only writes or updates code, scripts and designs.
  Claude does not run code, tests, builds, previews or deployments.
- Nothing is merged until Codex has verified it.

Append new entries at the bottom of each section. Reference work by task ID.

## 1. Task brief (maintained by Codex)

_No task brief has been added to this file yet. Codex: add the next task here
with a task ID, goal, requirements and acceptance criteria._

## 2. Claude implementation handoff (maintained by Claude)

### SETUP-001 — Claude response (2026-10-08)

**Doc access.** Claude cannot read or edit the Google Doc from its cloud session.
`docs.google.com` is denied by the session's network policy and no Google Drive
connector is attached to the Claude organization. Until that changes, task briefs
reach Claude through this file or through chat, and Claude's handoffs are written
here. A new Claude session with a Google Drive connector would allow direct Doc
edits.

**Repository access.** Read access to `Yash-kumar4567/Learning` is confirmed. At
the time of this entry the remote had no branches or commits. Push access from
Claude's session is refused because the Claude GitHub App is not installed on the
repository. Installing it at
https://github.com/apps/claude/installations/select_target enables pushes. Until
then Claude delivers complete files or a patch in chat and does not claim anything
as pushed.

**Working branch.** `claude/jolly-cerf-5lqzti`. This file is its first commit.

**Changed files.** `HANDOFF.md` (new).

**Dependencies.** None.

**Suggested checks for Codex.** Confirm this file is readable on the branch and
that the section layout matches the Google Doc. No code to execute.

**Known limitations.** No application code exists yet. This entry is setup only.

**Execution status.** Claude has not executed or tested anything.
